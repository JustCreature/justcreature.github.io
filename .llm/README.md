# LLM Workflow Documentation

This folder contains all documentation and artifacts related to working with AI assistants (Claude Code, etc.) on this project.

## Structure

- **CLAUDE.md** - Main instructions and guidelines for Claude Code when working with this codebase
- **features/** - Completed feature documentation (`done_F-{n}.md`)
- **tasks/todo/** - Planned feature specifications (`plan_F-{n}.md`)

## Purpose

Separating LLM-specific documentation from general project documentation helps:
- Keep AI workflow artifacts organized in one place
- Make it clear which docs are for human developers vs AI assistants
- Allow easy exclusion from deployments if needed
- Maintain cleaner project structure

## Feature Numbering

Features keep their original plan number throughout their lifecycle:
- `plan_F-6.md` (planned) → `done_F-6.md` (implemented)
- Numbers reflect when features were **planned**, not when they were **implemented**
- Gaps in numbering are expected and normal
