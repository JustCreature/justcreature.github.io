## Browser Compatibility

- **Camera Access**: Chrome 53+, Firefox 36+, Safari 11+
- **PWA Features**: Chrome 40+, Firefox 44+, Safari 11.1+
- **Local Storage**: All modern browsers
- **Geolocation**: All modern browsers

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All data stays on your device
- **No Server Communication**: App works completely offline
- **Permission-Based**: Camera and location access require user consent
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or data collection

## Google Drive Integration (Optional)

The app supports Google Drive integration for cloud backup, but requires additional setup:

### Setting Up Google Drive API

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   
2. **Enable Google Drive API**:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Drive API" and enable it

3. **Create Credentials**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
   - Restrict the API key to Google Drive API

4. **Add Google APIs JavaScript Client**:
   ```html
   <!-- Add to index.html -->
   <script src="https://apis.google.com/js/api.js"></script>
   ```

5. **Initialize in your app**:
   - Update the `googleDriveUtils.isAvailable()` function
   - Implement authentication flow
   - Handle file upload/download operations

**Note**: Without Google Drive setup, all import/export operations will use local file downloads, which works perfectly for most use cases.
